# Hierarchical-vs-Flat-Ensembles-in-RF-Modulation-Classification
We quantify when a parent HierarchicalMLClassifier beats a flat ensemble and vice versa. We report per-class win profiles, confusion deltas, and latency trade-offs, with code paths mapped to super().classify_signal() vs the ensemble voting block.
